# Movies ETL

## Project Overview.

This project creates an automated pipeline that takes Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data and creates an SQL database using PostgreSQL. This was done for the Amazing Prime Hackathon. Data was processed using jupyter notebook and PostgreSQL. The raw ratings and kaggle metadata were not uploaded to this repository because of size issues but can be found [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login?titleType=dataset-downloads&showDatasetDownloadSkip=False&messageId=datasetsWelcome&returnUrl=%2Fdatasets%2Frounakbanik%2Fthe-movies-dataset%3Fresource%3Ddownload)
